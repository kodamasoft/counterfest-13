The When They Cry series is one of the most beloved visual novel series of all time. This immense universe is loved by all kinds of people, of all kinds of horizons from all around the world. This album is meant as an homage album to celebrate it all in music.

Our next series-centered arrange album will be focused on the When They Cry series. It will be album KSDL-0006, and set to release for Comic Market 100 on August 13 of this year. The album will feature arrangements of the series, and will also permit image work to some extent. We are looking for artists willing to participate in this grand album/EP, and everyone is welcomed like always! There’s no limit to genres and style, so long as the finalized album has at least those three of those mandatory products represented in the final release:

- Higurashi When They Cry (PC Visual Novel)
- Umineko When They Cry (PC Visual Novel)
- Ciconia When They Cry (PC Visual Novel)

EVERYONE IS INVITED TO PARTICIPATE, AND THERE’S NO LIMIT TO THE AMOUNT OF PARTICIPATING ARTISTS! Don’t let your lack of experience cloud your will to join us. Please, by all means, come over and give it a try if you want to. Of course, it’s a passion project, but you will still be compensated for your work. The project is based on revenue share, and all artists will receive revenue from the album’s digital sales. If you participate, payment will be done individually and post-release, based on the album’s sales. All participating artists will take the same cut: All revenues from the sales will be divided by each individual that has worked on the release. As I am the one in charge of the Bandcamp and BOOTH pages, I will be in charge of banking the sales every month, and as I have done with previous albums, I will be sharing the total revenue across each person via PayPal, whenever needed (most people usually ask for the payout every few months, as requesting for the payout every month can be a repetitive process with little compensation considering our generally modest sales). In any case, please don’t expect too much from the sales. They make for some relatively okayish pocket change, but nobody will be making a living out of the album’s revenues. For now, the album is planned to release August 13 of 2022 for Comic Market 100. More information for the deadlines, participations, submissions and other below. We advise you to read the whole thing to get a better grasp of the project.

If you could share this to artists who you think may be interested, it’d be greatly appreciated!

## General Rules

The rules below apply to anyone willing to participate.

Do not participate if you do not have basic empathy, or sense of respect towards other people. This should go without saying, but any kind of toxic/aggressive misdemeanors are prohibited. The project is centered around inclusivity and diversity. If this is not not part of your values, please do not apply.

- (Not mandatory but highly recommended) Participate in the project’s general discussions on the KodamaSounds discord. If you wanna participate, say hi and tell us you’re here for that, and you shall gain access to the private artists channel. Since this is a community project, we’ll need to have you be okay with communicating about your art alongside a bunch of other artists.
- Have a valid Paypal account so we’ll be able to send you your revenue share, if you wish to receive payment. You do not have to absolutely receive payment, but all work deserves a reward, even if it’s light!
- No stealing assets. This should go without saying. Resampling shouldn’t be a problem, so long as you do not claim someone else’s work as your own.
- Keep secrecy on the project, especially when it comes to other artists than yourself.
- Send us complete and objective credits for your works. More information in the appropriate topics below.
- Do not let us know of your interest in the project at the last moment. We have deadlines and would rather avoid any last minute additions.
