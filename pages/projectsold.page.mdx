                <h2>{group.name}</h2>
                {group.desc ? <p>{group.desc}</p> : null}

                {group.projects.map(function (project) {

## Our Goals
- Bring together artists from all places & skills

We ensure we maintain a certain balance of skill sets, between veteran artists and artists that are just starting out. We authorize all people to participate in those albums, and we believe it is a good way for artists to form bonds with others while also permitting people to collaborate with people of all horizons to improve and create a good community experience, with no discrimination. No popularity contest, no favoritism: You wanna hop in? You can! And if you’re struggling, we’ll help out.

- Album ideas you don’t see elsewhere

More interesting and ambitious arrange albums for lesser-represented series out there. We are more than happy and proud to arrange albums for more niche & outcast game series.

- A constant stream of albums throughout the years

We ensure to publish as many albums as we can, spread out through the many Comic Market and M3 events.

- Crave variety

We make sure to accept all kinds of genres for our arrange albums, and there are many musically-themed album projects planned for our “ECLECTIC RESONANCE” original work series. If there’s a genre or style of music that is not yet represented on these albums, it surely will soon.
