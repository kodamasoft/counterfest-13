# Moonstruck Analogy -a TYPE​-​MOON tribute album-

*TYPE-MOON Projects, from Kara no Kyoukai to the recent Tsukihime remake, have been engraved in the minds of countless readers and players alike all around the globe. The objective of this album is to regroup our love of the Nasuverse into this hommage album series.*

## Presentation

“Moonstruck Analogy” is a variant of  our “tribute album” series, where the featured tracks are all centered around series from the extensive universe of games/books from TYPE-MOON. The list of accessible medias is very extensive, so here is a list of the products that are intended to be represented on the album, starting with the four imperative ones:
- Kara no Kyoukai
- Tsukihime / A piece of blue glass moon
- Fate/stay Night
- Mahoutsukai no Yoru: Witch on the Holy Night

Once the quota has been met for those four, you may be able to submit tracks for the following games:
- Any Fate/ spinoff (Fate/hollow ataraxia, /EXTRA, /Grand Order, /EXTELLA…)
- Any Tsukihime Spin-off (Melty Blood, Kagetsu Tohya…)
- Any piece of written publication (Original Novels, Mangas…)
- Any piece of animation related to TYPE-MOON

As usual, we can’t stress this enough: **EVERYONE IS INVITED, AND THERE’S NO LIMIT TO THE AMOUNT OF PARTICIPATING ARTISTS!** Don’t let your lack of experience cloud your will to join us. Please, by all means, come over and give it a try if you want to. **Of course, it’s a passion project, but you will still be compensated for your work. The project is based on revenue share, and all artists will receive revenue from the album’s digital sales.** If you participate, payment will be done individually and post-release, based on the album’s sales. All participating artists will take the same cut: All revenues from the sales will be divided by each individual that has worked on the release. As I am the one in charge of the Bandcamp and BOOTH pages, I will be in charge of banking the sales every month, and as I have done with previous albums, I will be sharing the total revenue across each person via PayPal, whenever needed (most people usually ask for the payout every few months, as requesting for the payout every month can be a repetitive process with little compensation considering our generally modest sales). Accepting payment is not mandatory and you can refuse or stop them at any time. In any case, **please don’t expect too much from the sales. They make for some relatively okayish pocket change, but nobody will be making a living out of the album’s revenues.**

Like all other albums, there are no deadlines: The album project will be over once we reach our usual threshold of runtime, and be released at the closest-coming M3/Comic Market event. <a href="/projects">More information about how it works can be found here.</a>

If you could share this to artists who you think may be interested, it’d be greatly appreciated!

## General Rules
The rules below apply to anyone willing to participate.

- Do not participate if you do not have basic empathy, or sense of respect towards other people. This should go without saying, but any kind of toxic/aggressive misdemeanors are prohibited. The project is centered around inclusivity and diversity. If this is not not part of your values, please do not apply.
- (Not mandatory but highly recommended) Participate in the project’s general discussions on the [KodamaSounds Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/9ZmHv3r). If you wanna participate, say hi and tell us you’re here for that, and you shall gain access to the private artists channel. Since this is a community project, we’ll need to have you be okay with communicating about your art alongside a bunch of other artists. 
- Have a valid PayPal account if you wish to receive payment. You do not have to absolutely receive payment, but all work deserves a reward, even if it’s light!
- No stealing assets. This should go without saying. Resampling shouldn’t be a problem, so long as you do not claim someone else’s work as your own.
- Keep secrecy on the project, especially when it comes to work that isn’t yours.
- Send us complete and objective credits for your works. More information in the appropriate topics below.
- Once your completed track has been confirmed and accepted for the album, you will be able to access the private artists channel dedicated to the album once the project is complete. This is where you will also be able to read the monthly revenue share as well.

### Music Specific Rules
- Follow the theme. We’re looking for anything that would fit in the styles mentioned in the presentation. Ask us and show us examples if you have doubts on what you can do, but as long as it doesn’t sound too bubbly it should probably be okay.
- Going through our own mastering engineer (malicent) is not necessary if your track already went through professional Mixing/Mastering, or if you are a professional yourself. But please note that we may post-master your track lightly if the sound is deemed too strong/low compared to the rest of the tracks on the album.
- We want quality. You will need to export a decently mixed master of your track in .wav format, in its purest form, as you originally want your track to sound like. All tracks will be checked thoroughly to make sure they follow our quality control. Lossy transcodes will very easily be perceived. Once the track has been received by our mastering engineer (if needed), we will deal with the mastering. We will make sure that your track has no loudness discrepancy within the album compared to other tracks.
- Be transparent with information. We WILL need as much information as we possibly can to make accurate credits. More about that below.
- You are free to send a maximum of three tracks for the current album project. But please note that this would be considered a bonus, and it would not influence the revenue share in any way since the revenue is based on the amount of participating individuals, rather than amount of tracks. There will be no revenue share difference whether you produced one or more tracks, so keep that in mind if you do this for that reason.
- Your track for the album must not have been previously published on any platform, and must be entirely new/original. The only exception to this rule is if you wish to remake a track you’ve produced before in the form of a notably different mix.
- Your submission must be entirely original in its entirety, and you must hold the rights of your composition. No partial arrangement of any series should be present in your submission.
- Your track needs to be at least 2 minutes minutes long, and cannot exceed 8 minutes.
- Artist name must not exceed 45 characters (both japanese and romanized)
- Track name must not exceed 60 roman characters and 25 japanese characters (for kanji only tracks)
- We may ask you to change your track name/artist name if it’s inappropriate or too dense/long. Specific symbols, punctuation, spaces may also impact this decision.
- Keep secrecy on your track. Do NOT show a preview on social media. You may however post your work in progress on the appropriate Discord channel. You can announce that you participate in the album, but please do not share anything related to the album’s direct content until announcement.

### Mastering
Please follow those rules for the final mix of your track, and export it with those settings:
- WAV 32bits, Floating Point.
- Resampling Quality of 512 point-sinc.
- Headroom around -6db to -12db.
- Don't use any Limiter or Clipper on the Mix Bus.

<u>Side notes:</u> 
- Same applies to full tracks or individual tracks in case of Mastering by stems.
- Make sure your mix is as accurate and decent as you can make it. The point of mastering isn't about fixing mixing errors, but about improving the sound of the final release.
- If you are not sure about the sound of your final mix, you can send it to our mastering engineer if you want a second opinion.

Upload your mix on a hosting site like Google Drive/MEGA, and send the access link to both our mastering engineer malicent through Discord messages preferably (malicent#6097), as well as the director of the album Fivda by mail ([kodamateam@gmail.com](mailto:kodamateam@gmail.com)), Twitter in private message at @KodamaSoft or @Fivda_,  or Discord directly (Robin#6328) alongside your credit information.

### Arrangement Rules
- Your submission must be only related to TYPE-MOON content, and by that, I mean in its entirety. No partial arrangement of any other series should be presented in your submission. You can however, of course, mix multiple games/tracks in your submission as long as all source material originates from TYPE-MOON.
- No original music from fangames should be arranged. The concerned games you can arrange for this album are the official and original soundtracks for the visual novels and the Kara no Kyoukai movie series. Like said above, please try to focus on the aforementioned 4 series rather than the spinoffs.
- You cannot re-arrange tracks from other doujin albums. Slight and obvious references may be permitted depending on how important it is to the track. This is a subject of discussion, so make sure to ask and show us an example if you plan on doing this.
- [Please check the track claiming Google Sheet page to add the track(s) & game(s) you wish to arrange in the form of a comment on a line of cells.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f0FQD-40D8jDWyEL4v2caypPzDJ7OgmXDJ9AY711cKM/edit#gid=0) Tracks from the last released Moonstruck Analogy album are generally on cooldown, as well as tracks arranged from the last DJ Koishi album. We crave variety, so make sure you avoid picking a track someone else might do as well. Please note that tracks on cool down tracks may change, as we constantly release Touhou albums every now and then.

### Original Work Rules
If you feel inspired, it’s possible for you to make original work for the album. This is kind of a blurry line, but the only requirement is that your track needs to “feel related” to the aimed product in some way. Of course it’s not like there’s any rigid proof for that, especially when it comes to instrumental music, but the general idea behind original/image work is that you need to compose and arrange your track in spirit with the Series, a character, a place, a scene, etc. You’ll of course need to specify what product you’re trying to represent. For those kinds of submissions, you will need to add a comment to explain how your track is related to whatever product you aim to represent.


### Submissions Format & Credits
