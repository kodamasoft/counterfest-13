# ECLECTIC RESONANCE Detuned Alloy

*Grab your gear, and get your fingers in shape: Detuned Alloy is an album for all guitar lovers out there.*

<WrappableParagraph title="Presentation">
“Detuned Alloy” is the Rock/Hard Rock/Metal variant of our “ECLECTIC RESONANCE” original work album series, where the featured tracks are focused on all kinds of acoustic/rock music styles. For centuries, guitars and guitar-like instruments have been used for their flexibility and sonic characteristics. More recently, innovations such as the electric guitar have completely transformed and defined the sounds of genres ranging from blues and rock to heavy metal and jazz. Whether clean or distorted, acoustic or electric, the timbre of the guitar has affected or shaped a significant portion of the music that we listen to today, and KodamaSounds is celebrating that legacy with ECLECTIC RESONANCE Detuned Alloy.
