    "desc": "Sometimes you just need a good burst of dopamine to help through tough times. Sometimes you just need to headbang to some absurd tunes. Absurd drums, absurd sampling… Some might call it music for the deranged, and not for the faint of heart. Maybe they’re right. But we’re into it, and that’s not gonna stop us from making even more. ECLECTIC RESONANCE UPRISING is all about original hardcore electronic music, J-core, and whatever name you wanna give it."

  "eclectic-resonance-detuned-alloy": {
    "desc": "Grab your gear, and get your fingers in shape: Detuned Alloy is an album for all guitar lovers out there. “Detuned Alloy” is the Rock/Hard Rock/Metal variant of our “ECLECTIC RESONANCE” original work album series, where the featured tracks are focused on all kinds of acoustic/rock music styles. For centuries, guitars and guitar-like instruments have been used for their flexibility and sonic characteristics. More recently, innovations such as the electric guitar have completely transformed and defined the sounds of genres ranging from blues and rock to heavy metal and jazz. Whether clean or distorted, acoustic or electric, the timbre of the guitar has affected or shaped a significant portion of the music that we listen to today, and KodamaSounds is celebrating that legacy with ECLECTIC RESONANCE Detuned Alloy."
