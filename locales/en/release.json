  "speedstars": {
    "desc": "“Alright everyone, one minute to go! Are you ready to go?” SpeedSTARS is our tribute album dedicated to the RIDGE RACER series, to celebrate the series in all its glory. Ahead of its time, the series managed to bring elements of European EDM onto Arcade CRT screens as far back as the early 90’s, back when VGM was just starting to get into serious territory. Dearly beloved by many, SpeedSTARS will celebrate this in a multitude of genres and styles. This album is part of the \"United Tribute Arrange Force\" project celebrating the 70th anniversary of Namco's founding."
