    "desc": "Sometimes you just need a good burst of dopamine to help through tough times. Sometimes you just need to headbang to some absurd tunes. Absurd drums, absurd sampling… Some might call it music for the deranged, and not for the faint of heart. Maybe they’re right. But we’re into it, and that’s not gonna stop us from making even more. ECLECTIC RESONANCE UPRISING is all about original hardcore electronic music, J-core, and whatever name you wanna give it."
