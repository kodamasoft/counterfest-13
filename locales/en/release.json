    "desc": "Alright everyone, one minute to go! Are you ready to go?” SpeedSTARS is our tribute album dedicated to the RIDGE RACER series, to celebrate the series in all its glory. Ahead of its time, the series managed to bring elements of European EDM onto Arcade CRT screens as far back as the early 90’s, back when VGM was just starting to get into serious territory. Dearly beloved by many, SpeedSTARS will celebrate this in a multitude of genres and styles. This album is part of the \"United Tribute Arrange Force\" project celebrating the 70th anniversary of Namco's founding."

    "desc": "\"Collection of Liquid Drum & Bass works from 2021~2024. This album is a testament to almost 4 years of producing, while still not finding what I truly enjoy making. Perhaps, one could say I'm lost. But at the same time, I've been lost forever yet I've never felt like it was truly a problem. So Let's hope the next few years are equally filled with both ups and downs - I think this is what makes my life so interesting. Liquid DnB has been a great genre to produce over the years, with inspiration by Makoto, LSB, Harry Shotta, and many more. While being a genre I sometimes consider as 'lazy' or 'uninspired', I still think it's one of the widest subgenres of drum & bass, considering the range of instruments—both synthetic and acoustic—which can be used. The cover artwork and video visuals are a love letter to my magnificent country and region - the French Alps, and showcase something I really enjoy: taking deep breaths outside through driving, hiking or cycling. The photo was taken in 2023 during a bivouac and is the westside of Taillefer from the Plateau des Lacs, and various videos were taken from 2021 to today on various trips and hikes, by car, foot or bicycle. And to you, a message: touch grass. go up that hill. it's worth it. nature's where the mind is free.\""
