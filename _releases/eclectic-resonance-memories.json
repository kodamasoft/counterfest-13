				"• About this track: This was a fun piece to write; it uses YM2151 (FM), Wonderswan (wavetable) and RF5C68 (PCM), a combination that would otherwise not be possible without the Swiss army knife that is Furnace. I was particularly inspired by late 80s/early 90s Sega arcade game music, such as OutRunners and Thunder Blade, but I decided to get more experimental particularly later in the track. In short, it really is digital fusion. I hope you enjoy it!"

				"• About this track: The first 30 seconds of this track are nearly unmodified from an old experiment when I first dipped my toes into composing for the NES sound chip. Working under the constraints of only having 3 tonal channels was quite fun, but for a more complete musical concept, I needed to add on the VRC6 expansion chip for the rest of this track."

I decided to participate in this album on a whim, figuring it could be a good chance to improve at chiptune, and it really went a long way in helping me better grasp how to approach the genre. Between the jazzy melodies and structural fluidity, I'd like to think I did quite well."

				"チップチューンの要素を含む曲は、これまでに何曲か作ったことはあるのですが、チップチューンのルールに完全に従って作ったのは今回が初めてです！最初のバージョンはドラムだけチップチューンでは無かったのですが、アドバイスをもらって完全な曲になりました。しかし、これは大変な作業ですね……。先人の知恵と工夫に対して、改めて最大限の敬意を送ります。そして、頑張って作ったので何回も聞いてくれ！",
				"# EN",
				"I've made a few songs containing chiptune elements until now, but this is the first time I've made a track while completely respecting hardware limitations! The first version had non-chiptune drums, but thanks to some advice that I was given, I could perfect the track. I'll admit, it was pretty hard... I have the utmost respect for the ingenuity and the intelligence of my predecessors. I did my best for this track, so I hope you'll listen to it again and again!"
