Working under the constraints of only having 3 tonal channels was quite fun, but for a more complete musical concept, I needed to add on the VRC6 expansion chip for the rest of this track."

I decided to participate in this album on a whim, figuring it could be a good chance to improve at chiptune, and it really went a long way in helping me better grasp how to approach the genre. Between the jazzy melodies and structural fluidity, I'd like to think I did quite well."
