				"I've made a few songs containing chiptune elements until now, but this is the first time I've made a track while completely respecting hardware limitations! The first version had non-chiptune drums, but thanks to some advice that I was given, I could perfect the track. I'll admit, it was pretty hard... I have the utmost respect for the ingenuity and the intelligence of my predecessors. I did my best for this track, so I hope you'll listen to it again and again!",
				"",
				"# JP",
				"チップチューンの要素を含む曲は、これまでに何曲か作ったことはあるのですが、チップチューンのルールに完全に従って作ったのは今回が初めてです！最初のバージョンはドラムだけチップチューンでは無かったのですが、アドバイスをもらって完全な曲になりました。しかし、これは大変な作業ですね……。先人の知恵と工夫に対して、改めて最大限の敬意を送ります。そして、頑張って作ったので何回も聞いてくれ！"

I was particularly inspired by late 80s/early 90s Sega arcade game music, such as OutRunners and Thunder Blade, but I decided to get more experimental particularly later in the track. In short, it really is digital fusion. I hope you enjoy it!"

				"The Yamaha YMF262 (OPL3) — it has long been a personal aspiration of mine. In all the years over the course of my career I never got the chance to use it. However, a friend introduced me to Furnace Tracker in January 2024. This was a big deal for me. What you are about to hear is my very first OPL3 composition. Up until now I had been focusing on creating heavy sounds, but this time I found a different world within myself. I hope you enjoy Hierarchy of L, which follows a minimalist progression yet utilizes every sound channel of the OPL3.",

				"私にとって長年の憧れであり続けたYAMAHA YMF262 (OPL3)。しかしそれに触れるチャンスは私のキャリアでは実現することはなく、長い月日が流れました。しかし、2024年の1月に友人の勧めでfurnace tracker と出会うことになります。これは私にとって大きな出来事になりました。この楽曲は私にとって人生初めて取り組むOPL3作品であります。これまで私は重厚な響きを生み出すことに力を注いできましたが、今回はそれとは違う世界を自分自身に求めました。OPL3が持つ発音チャンネル全てを使いながらもミニマルに展開していく「Hierarchy of L」をお楽しみいただけたら幸いです。"

So the name doesn't mean anything unless someone wants to imagine something to go along with it.  If you let me kind of give my own impression post finishing the track of what it could be about, I picture a really cool action hero called Eclypse. It dresses really cool like a ninja and you fight it in a classic bullet hell-like shootem up. So in a way its like a touhou level but worse because he isn't a really cute girl, and I can't make a good touhou-like track...."

				"• About this track: I have \"No Time 2 Dwell\" much on this track since I started it around a week before the deadline. University studies don't give you a lot of free time, sadly... The track was done with 2A03 (NES/FC soundchip) only, with around 1.6KB worth of DPCM samples. I tried to go for a 2-step garage style, which isn't at all a common genre on this system but lends itself well to extreme pattern data optimisation. I threw in a bit of morse code, and used the FDS error sound as the alarm sound you'd hear in just about any UK garage track. God I love the Casio Rapman's samples - they're so cheesy, even when converted to DPCM."

With very little attack. And so I wanted to pursue that idea with this track! I've also been relistening to the stuff I used to listen to in like 2009, like early deadmau5, Owl City, and LapFox Trax stuff. And I wanted to incorporate stuff like that! Actually this song reminds me of the first \"serious\" electronic music I made back then. so this song is nostalgic for me haha."
