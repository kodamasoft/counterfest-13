				"Robin: The first thing that came to mind when creating Moriya Barista (as an album) was to inaugurate this series with a bombastic, fully live performed jazz track. I thought the occasion was great, and we got to involve a lot of different artists, with nearly nothing but brand new participants, which felt like a perfect breath of fresh air as a whole! KODAMA JAMS will be our unit name used within the circle whenever we will be performing live performed jazz/fusion tracks within Kodama Sounds from now on. Of course, the name was inspired by CASIOPEA\"s album MINT JAMS for a sly reference. I hope you enjoy this incredible track to the fullest!",
				"",
				"Philip Saguil: I was recommended for this project through a sister arrangement group, Resonant Union. Little did I know the arranger of the piece was someone I worked before professionally on a large game project! The world moves in mysterious ways."

I don't have much to say about this one since I'm playing it too close to the deadline again (*laughs*), but I just thought I would specify that this is a completely reimagined jazz version of my arrange \"春の氷精 -Spring of Eternity-\" from my album \"Eternal Spring of Resonation\", which was released digitally back in May for Reitaisai 19. I had originally planned on making a jazzy arrange of Patchouli's theme \"Locked Girl ~ The Girl's Secret Room\" from Touhou 6 for this album, but that wasn't allowed since it was arranged by someone else for the previous Gensokyo Party album (it definitely wouldn't have been as amazing as that arrange anyway ^^). I hope you enjoyed this sorta experimental jazzy rock arrange of mine, which is based on the title screen theme from Touhou 12.8! Now let's chill out to the rest of the album together~"

Tho this time Instead of a medley,  it's one song being arranged (one of my favorites!, tho that can be said about all tracks I have arranged, but whatever).  Honestly I think it's a bit too upbeat in contrast to other tracks? but At least I hope it sticks out in a good way despite my sloppy guitar solo. "

When I heard of this project, I was very inspired and I immediatly started to experiment some ideas. It ended to a mix of some progressive breakbeat with jazzy elements. I wanted to make a song that can be playable and performed by a band in a bar. I also wanted this song to sound like a human performance. It took me almost four months to get to this result. This song is a reference to a french bar I went into several months ago. The ambience of the bar was so chillout that somehow it inspired me to make a song that illustrates that."
