There's basically never really been any trace of any arrange album for this series, and I'm glad to have been able to make it happen. Originally, this song was supposed to be a major mashup of songs of the girlbosses from NMH1, with Samurai Summer, Rocket Surgeon, and was supposed to finish with Pleather for Breakfast, but this idea was a bit too ambitious for both me and AIKATYPE. Originally, my take on Samurai Summer was much more schranzy and was mixed much louder. But I think that AIKATYPE's general direction was smoother and a safer techno direction, and I'm glad we somehow wrapped it up before the deadline, lol. I once again wished I could have contributed more to this track, but once again, the narration ended up being the only place where I was really useful, alongside some of the remaining Samurai Summer pads/elements... Let's hope I can make a DJ ROUGE-GORGE remix on my own for the next album!"

Sorry, Travis. I love the sounds of Indonesian percussion, so there's a lot of gamelan instruments in this song, which I think fits pretty nicely. "

					"• Original Composer: Masafumi Takada","• Arranger: Monochrome","","• Programmed, Produced & Mixed by Monochrome","• Mastering Engineer: malicent (Cursed Monastery / Sigillum Azoetia)","","• Original Track: Cashmere Cannonball","• Source: No More Heroes","","• About this track: I run another arrangement project, and one part of it focuses on Suda51 works. I wasn't a prior fan of No More Heroes, and I had little interest in getting into it, but in doing work for this project, I slowly became exposed to the music of Suda51's games and found myself intrigued by what I heard. That primed me for work on Midnight Syndrome. My original intent was to arrange \"It's Kill or Be Killed Mix\" from No More Heroes 2, but due to time constraints and a lack of confidence, I opted for \"Cashmere Cannonball\" instead. However, I still wished to inject some of the jazz fusion flair of \"It's Kill or Be Killed Mix\", which is how I settled on this sound. For the end of the song, just to put a little more meat on its bones, I decided to mimic the drum pattern of \"Beam Katana Chronicles\", which managed to slot in pretty seamlessly as a breakdown. It took me some time to amp myself up for the endeavor, but I ultimately had great fun translating its electronic properties into a faux-acoustic setting and playing around with some recently-purchased VSTs."

After working on a failed remix of another song from the game, I decided to remix Travesty instead, after relistening and realising it had perfect big beat riff energy, like the kind of thing you'd hear in a Tekken 3 song, so I went all in with the idea. Watch out for Jasper Batt Jr's new Big Batt album, The Batt of The Land. In stores never. [some sort of joke about Pizza Bat and the alias Pizzaman goes here]"

Takada-san's composition always stood out, and it has a consistency throughout his time with Grasshopper that gives their games of that era a strong character. \"killer7\" was my first Grasshopper game, and it made an extremely strong impact on me. I played \"The Silver Case\" later, and it affected me in different ways. While thinking about the project, I wondered if there was a way I could represent both titles in one track? For a while, I've thought that \"Apricot Square\" and \"Dissociative Identity\" both have strong piano melodies that could complement each other well, so I began with them. In fact, several elements of each track - melodies, chords, instruments - seemed to work together famously. I didn't have to make many alterations at all, just enough to keep things in key. I wrote a new bass line based on the roots of \"DI\", and introduced a second lead in the background to make the piece more my own. I think it still leans more towards \"DI\" than \"AS\" overall, likely because the former is a more developed idea in my opinion. I hope you enjoy it! I look forward to ever more unique experiences from Grasshopper. ^^","• Lyrics","kill the past","burn it","if you have to",""
