I never ended up releasing it, but when time came for Legendaria to close, I asked Emma if she would write lyrics and sing over it for the submission. She said yes, and turned the instrumental into a gorgeous song!","Could you hear me then?","Calling out your name when","No one else","Would listen","","The flowers, the swords within you","You're caught between worlds -","Your dreams obscure your vision","Your dreams obscure your vision","","But no matter what","You choose to do","I am with you","","But here alone beneath this tree","& this silver sky","There's a storm in my eyes","I stay the same so you can change","","Could you see me then?","In the center of the crowd when","You were being sent away","","I knew you'd find a way to stay ","I looked up at the stars","I knew that they were ours","","I knew that just as the sand","Cannot evade the blue sea","Your soul will break down their ","Walls just to return home to me","","In the woods, in the meadow,","Or down by the shore","I'll wait for you, as I have before"

				"• Composer & Arranger: Skyleo","• Programmed, Produced & Mixed by Skyleo","• Mastering Engineer: R-Man (Resonant Union)","","• Used Software: Cubase","• Used VSTs & Samples: Embertone - Joshua Bell Violin (solo violin); Spectrasonics - Trilian (synth bass); Roland JV-1080 + SRX Orchestra (all the rest)","","• About this track: This track focuses on the softer and meditative side of old school JRPG music.  It is one of my belief that JRPGs soundtracks did a lot of good for classical music. The extent of the influence of classical music in those kind of music is non-negligible and, as a result, an extraordinary amount of JRPGs got symphonic arrangements albums and concerts. A lot of those concerts, despite being held in usually classical venues, are often sold-out. Most of the people attending are young and not the kind to be classical concertgoers. The main instruments of this track are the violin and piano, two staples of western classical music, whether it is in chamber music or pieces written for large ensembles. The other instruments and sounds are almost all from an old rompler featured prominently in 90's RPGs, with most of these aforementioned RPGs seeing symphonic arrangements later down the line.","","BPM: 76","Key: B minor","Genre: Castlecore"

The title itself is a reference to a track from Chrono Cross often known as \"The Grasslands of Time: Home World\", and the influence of Yasunori Mitsuda is overall quite obvious. Other than that, I also took inspiration from various folk music, especially Spanish ones. The harmonies and melodies also shows some influences from a Japanese band named Choro Club, who themselves are primarily influenced by diverse folk music. Those are all pretty natural influences and inspirations of mine, so this track is kind of a candid love letter to them."

Can you tell I'm still very new to flute. The section around 2:15 is the rififi part, the rest is Ville Fleurie"

It's a little bit hacky, but please enjoy! I put a lot of my favorite sounds in it. I'm starting to think this style is a little different from what usually goes on these albums..."

After working on a failed remix of another song from the game, I decided to remix Travesty instead, after relistening and realising it had perfect big beat riff energy, like the kind of thing you'd hear in a Tekken 3 song, so I went all in with the idea. Watch out for Jasper Batt Jr's new Big Batt album, The Batt of The Land. In stores never. [some sort of joke about Pizza Bat and the alias Pizzaman goes here]"

				"• Original Composer: Masafumi Takada","• Arranger: Hal Binderman","","• Programmed, Produced & Mixed by Hal Binderman","• Mastering Engineer: malicent (Cursed Monastery / Sigillum Azoetia)","","• Original Track: Apricot Square","• Source: The Silver Case","• Original Track: Dissociative Identity","• Source: killer7","","• Used Software: Reason 12","• Used VSTs & Samples: plogue Chipspeech, Reason Drum Kits, Reason Electric Bass, Radical Keys, Malstrom","","• About this track: Early Grasshopper games have a strong presence in my mind, especially when it comes to music. Takada-san's composition always stood out, and it has a consistency throughout his time with Grasshopper that gives their games of that era a strong character. \"killer7\" was my first Grasshopper game, and it made an extremely strong impact on me. I played \"The Silver Case\" later, and it affected me in different ways. While thinking about the project, I wondered if there was a way I could represent both titles in one track? For a while, I've thought that \"Apricot Square\" and \"Dissociative Identity\" both have strong piano melodies that could complement each other well, so I began with them. In fact, several elements of each track - melodies, chords, instruments - seemed to work together famously. I didn't have to make many alterations at all, just enough to keep things in key. I wrote a new bass line based on the roots of \"DI\", and introduced a second lead in the background to make the piece more my own. I think it still leans more towards \"DI\" than \"AS\" overall, likely because the former is a more developed idea in my opinion. I hope you enjoy it! I look forward to ever more unique experiences from Grasshopper. ^^","• Lyrics","kill the past","burn it","if you have to",""
