This arrange was quite the undertaking, it was supposed to be Hideki Naganuma-style at first, but it ended up evolving into its own thing, especially once I reached the chorus and the Jamiroquai inspiration hit me like a truck. I'm happy about this change haha, I think it made the arrangement more dynamic and more fun with this delicious blend of flavours. I hope you enjoy it! B)",

				"• About this track: This track is a complete remake and fusion of my old track \"Horizon Highway\" and AJURIKA's \"Purple Sky\". Horizon Highway was one of my first songs released in 2018, which was a DnB track that tried to capture the sense of standing on a bridge above an urban highway at night, the trails of red and white lights zooming past. Upon the creation of the remake, I slowed down the track and replaced some elements with trance elements, and realized it sounded quite similar to Purple Sky. From there, I decided to make a tribute by calling back to my roots, making the song younger me was trying to make, hoping little NATSUKA will smile. This particular iteration of the track tries to capture the last stretch adrenaline of Ridge Racer, with nothing but one tank of nitro left to push you through the last few turns, battling and protecting your position of 1st place. I hope you enjoy this remake of a track made almost a decade ago!",

			"• About this track: I made the decision to scale back on my workload in the middle of the year, and SpeedSTARS was one of the albums I backed out of.  I honestly believed I wouldn't participate, as I lacked both the time to work on it and the connection to the Ridge Racer franchise and its music.  But I kept up with the United Tribute Arrange Force's various Namco tribute albums - contributing to a few myself - and more and more I realized I wanted to at least try to do something for SpeedSTARS.  I credit ANGELWHISPER for giving me the push to make something, even if it was short, and for directing me towards Rage Racer's OST.  I was able to have a lot of fun trying out rally house for the first time - this album seemed like a perfect test drive for that, and I was so into the track that I whipped it up in just 2 days.  Special thank you to suzie for her last-minute voiceover cameo as the Rage Racer narrator!",
