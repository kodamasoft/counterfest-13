This arrange was quite the undertaking, it was supposed to be Hideki Naganuma-style at first, but it ended up evolving into its own thing, especially once I reached the chorus and the Jamiroquai inspiration hit me like a truck. I'm happy about this change haha, I think it made the arrangement more dynamic and more fun with this delicious blend of flavours. I hope you enjoy it! B)",

				"• About this track: This track is a complete remake and fusion of my old track \"Horizon Highway\" and AJURIKA's \"Purple Sky\". Horizon Highway was one of my first songs released in 2018, which was a DnB track that tried to capture the sense of standing on a bridge above an urban highway at night, the trails of red and white lights zooming past. Upon the creation of the remake, I slowed down the track and replaced some elements with trance elements, and realized it sounded quite similar to Purple Sky. From there, I decided to make a tribute by calling back to my roots, making the song younger me was trying to make, hoping little NATSUKA will smile. This particular iteration of the track tries to capture the last stretch adrenaline of Ridge Racer, with nothing but one tank of nitro left to push you through the last few turns, battling and protecting your position of 1st place. I hope you enjoy this remake of a track made almost a decade ago!",
