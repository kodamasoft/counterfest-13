# ECLECTIC RESONANCE UPRISING 2

*Sometimes you just need a good burst of dopamine to help through tough times. Sometimes you just need to headbang to some absurd tunes. Absurd drums, absurd sampling… Some might call it music for the deranged, and not for the faint of heart. Maybe they’re right. But we’re into it, and that’s not gonna stop us from making even more. ECLECTIC RESONANCE UPRISING is all about original hardcore electronic music, J-core, and whatever name you wanna give it.*

<WrappableParagraph title="Presentation">
“Uprising” is the J-Core variant of  our “ECLECTIC RESONANCE” original work album series, where the featured tracks are inspired by some of the most hardcore & insane music out there. Globally inspired by the doujin scene, rhythm game music and other labels such as HARDCORE TANO*C and artists such as DJ Sharpnel, the idea is to make intense music heavily relying on crazy drum programming, and anything deriving from those. The scope is rather big, but generally, we are looking for specific styles of electronic music. Ideally, we want a specific style of hardcore music.
