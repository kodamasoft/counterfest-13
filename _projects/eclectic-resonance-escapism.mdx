# ECLECTIC RESONANCE Escapism

*Focus on what’s ahead. Contemplate tomorrow, take a breather, and let your soul wash away all of its pain - escape, and ascend.*

<WrappableParagraph title="Presentation">
“Escapism” is an “ECLECTIC RESONANCE” original work entry with a focus on Uplifting sonorities, and progressiveness. Inspired by long pieces and intoxicating trance/progressive house, we hope that you can close your eyes while listening to this album, and feel ready to face the day.

<WrappableParagraph title="Escapism Specific Music Rules">
- Your submission must be entirely original in its entirety, and you must hold the rights of your composition. No partial arrangement of any series should be present in your submission.
- Your track needs to be at least 4 minutes long, and cannot exceed 11 minutes.
- There is no imposed BPM.
- Your track must be within the style aimed for Escapism. Here are some genres/keywords that may help you.
    - Progressive Trance
    - Uplifting Trance
    - Progressive House
    - Hypertrance / Hard trance (so long as it sounds uplifting & powerful, rather than “edgy”)
    - Other dreamlike EDM genres
- Here are some genres/tones to avoid:
    - Psytrance & UK Hardcore should be avoided, as it is more appropriate to our “UPRISING” series.
    - Traditional Techno, dark IDM, and other darker tones are more appropriate for our “hollow horizons” series.
- Drum & Bass / Bass / Hardcore music in general isn’t appropriate, but it is not a hard rule. Depending on the tone, it may make it in. We greatly recommend you to share your piece to the supervisor and check the [inspiration playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDVKVVXsPYipPEdQEj92oxM6ZjO1xuxQ1) to know if it would fit. You don’t have to explicitly make progressive house / traditional trance pieces to make it in, as the song needs to evoke a sense of elevation and contemplation. Therefore, uplifting IDM / Botanica / D&B / Color Bass / Artcore can be accepted to some extent if the emotion feels right. Remember, Escapism is the key word, hence why a sense of ascension and upliftingness matter the most.
