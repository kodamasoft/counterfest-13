# COUNTERFEST HEROES 01

SAMPLING IS GOD. COUNTERFEST is here for all the HEROES who explore the limits of what they wish to do. COUNTERFEST HEROES will be our regular compilation filled with sample abuse, breakbeats, tek, bass music, ultra specific bootlegs of games, anime, whatever arrangement of turbo niche media you can think of, and anything too unsafe for KodamaSounds’ regular schedule.

<WrappableParagraph title="Presentation">
    COUNTERFEST HEROES aims at exploring niche subcultures, whether they take root from otaku or worldwide cultures. We are looking for both fully original songs, original songs with intense sampling of existing songs, as well as arrangements and remixes.

<WrappableParagraph title="COUNTERFEST HEROES 01 Specific Music Rules">

This compilation is complicated to grasp and to explain outside of vibes alone, but we will try to make the guidelines as explicit and permissive as possible for you to understand what we are looking for.

- Overall, any original song must feel tied and attached to the essence behind the bootleg scene. Anyone who is familiar with such scenes should be able to understand their implications, so if you understand this rule, there shouldn’t be any issue with your submission.

- Any genre is technically permitted, but the main drive of this compilation is around club music, especially bass music and hardcore music. Although this may show similarity to other KodamaSounds projects like UPRISING, please try to do things that you normally wouldn’t be able to do for COUNTERFEST HEROES instead with those recommended genres:
    - Breakcore
    - Hardtek
    - Drum and Bass
    - Gabber
    - Hard Dance
    - Jersey Club
    - Funkot
    - Makina
    - Full flavor is permitted

- Arrangements/Remixes that aren’t tied to any aforementioned genres will need to feel appropriate within the rest of the compilation, so depending on the style of the song, it may not necessarily make it.

- It is completely fine to make an original song for this compilation without resampling existing media.

- There isn’t a clear limit for resampling, but we are generally in favor of sampling games, anime, shows, movies and music from otaku culture. We would also love to feature resampling from more niche media, like region-exclusive cartoons, for example. Ressampling more mainstream songs isn’t forbidden either, though not exactly recommended either for obvious reasons. Just know what you’re doing.
