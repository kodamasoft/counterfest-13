# FAQ/Additional Information

*This section is dedicated for general guidelines that apply to all of our projects. Though quite long, it will be appreciated if you can get through it all to have a better grasp at the way the circle works.*


<WrappableParagraph title="General Rules">
The rules below apply to anyone willing to participate.
- Do not participate if you do not have basic empathy, or sense of respect towards other people. This should go without saying, but any kind of toxic/aggressive misdemeanors are prohibited. The project is centered around inclusivity and diversity.  If this is not not part of your values, please do not apply.
- (Not mandatory but highly recommended) Participate in the project’s general discussions on the [KodamaSounds discord](/discord). If you wanna participate, say hi and tell us you’re here for that, and you shall gain access to the private artists channel. Since this is a community project, we’ll need to have you be okay with communicating about your art alongside a bunch of other artists. 
- Have a valid Paypal account if you wish to receive payment. You do not have to absolutely receive payment, but all work deserves a reward, even if it’s light!
- Keep secrecy on the project, especially when it comes to work that isn’t yours.
</WrappableParagraph>

<WrappableParagraph title="Production Procedure">
1. It is recommended to participate on the [Discord server of the community](/discord) or get in contact with the album supervisors through Mail, Discord, or Twitter DMs (contact info is available on each project page) to ensure your song stays within the theme. Feel free to post works in progress or ask questions in the project channels.
1. Once you think your song is complete, please submit it on the appropriate Google Form. The supervisor may get in touch with you again to confirm your formatted credits for the album, and confirm your PayPal contact information if you choose to perceive royalties from album sales.
1. If you chose to see your master supervised, we will get in touch with you to confirm satisfaction of your mastered song before release.
1. Once mastering of the album has been fully finalised, you will get your fully mastered song alongside assets (artwork, cover art, logo) to promote your song before and after release.
1. Once the album is released, you will receive a Bandcamp key of the album you have worked on.
1. Make sure to follow the [terms of use](https://kodamasoft.net/projects/faq#terms-of-use) for your song after release.
1. Post release, you will be able to check each month’s royalty payment on the project channel.
1. Royalty payment will happen **every year, in early July**. If your PayPal information has changed, make sure to let us know before the payment day.

<WrappableParagraph title="Album / Track Rules">
- Your track for the album must not have been previously published on any platform, and must be entirely new/original. The only exception to this rule is if you wish to remake a track you’ve produced before in the form of a notably different mix.
- Send us complete and objective credits for your works. Be transparent with information. We WILL need as much information as we possibly can to make accurate credits. More information in the appropriate topics below.
- Artist name must not exceed 45 characters (both japanese and romanized)
- Track name must not exceed 60 roman characters and 25 japanese characters (for kanji only tracks)
- We may ask you to change your track name/artist name if it’s inappropriate or too dense/long. Specific symbols, punctuation, spaces may also impact this decision.
- Keep secrecy on your track. Do NOT show a preview on social media. You may however post your work in progress on the appropriate Discord channel. You can announce that you participate in the album, but please do not share anything related to the album’s direct content until announcement.
- No stealing assets. This should go without saying. Resampling shouldn’t be a problem, so long as you do not claim someone else’s work as your own.
- Follow the album’s theme. We’re looking for anything that would fit in the styles mentioned in the album page. Ask us and show us examples if you have doubts on what you can do.
- You are free to send a maximum of two tracks for the same album project. But please note that this would be considered a bonus, and it would not influence the revenue share in any way since the revenue is based on the amount of participating individuals, rather than amount of tracks. There will be no revenue share difference whether you produced one or two tracks, so keep that in mind if you do this for that reason.
- Once your completed track has been confirmed and accepted for the album, you will be able to access the private artists channel dedicated to the album once the project is complete. This is where you will also be able to read the monthly revenue share as well.
- We authorize anyone to participate and contribute to the albums, but please understand that we have quality/selection standards which may affect our decision to add your submission to the album. Please do not take it the wrong way if that ever happens - we can always discuss to see if your submission can be improved on and the community will be glad to help you out if we think the song has some potential for the album in question, or a different one altogether.
</WrappableParagraph>

<WrappableParagraph title="Mix/Mastering">
Please follow those rules for the final mix of your track, and export it with those settings:
- WAV 44.1 kHz / 24bit
- Headroom around -6db to -12db.
- Do not use any Limiter or Clipper on the Mix Bus.

### Side notes
- Going through our own mastering engineer is not necessary if your track already went through professional Mixing/Mastering, or if you are a professional yourself. But please note that we may post-master your track lightly if the sound is deemed too strong/low compared to the rest of the tracks on the album.
- Same above rules apply to full tracks or individual tracks in case of mastering by stems.
- Make sure your mix is as accurate as you can make it. The point of mastering isn't about fixing mixing errors, but about improving the sound of the final release.
- If you are not sure about the sound of your final mix, you can share it on our Discord community if you want a second opinion from other artists or the album’s mastering engineer.
</WrappableParagraph>

<WrappableParagraph title="File Information">
Please go through the project's Google Forms enclosed on each project page to send us your track, and link to a direct upload (or folder) of your finalized mix. Please go through a hosting site like Google Drive/MEGA, and make sure that you sent us the access key for the file so we can download and gain access to it. If you'd prefer, you can also send it to us directly through mail, Twitter or Discord so long as you give us the necessary information in text form.
</WrappableParagraph>

<WrappableParagraph title="Credits Guidelines">
For manual and direct submission, please format the credits of your musical submission in such a way and send it to Fivda (contact information all the way down):

**IMPORTANT NOTE FOR PEOPLE USING JAPANESE:**
If you are using an artist name and track name containing kana/kanji, please let us know of the exact romanized reading for both of them. We prefer localized/translated track names over basic romanization, and uniformized artist names. (Example: “Chikyuu no De [地球の出]”) If you don’t think you have the skill to translate your japanese trackname, you can leave it to us. Make sure to input both english/japanese names in the credits. If you want to go with a kana/kanji name, it will only be visible on BOOTH. Other platforms/the website will be using your romanized reading/translated track name.
</WrappableParagraph>


<WrappableParagraph title="Scope">
We can’t stress this enough: For our KodamaSounds projects, **EVERYONE IS INVITED, AND THERE’S NO LIMIT TO THE AMOUNT OF PARTICIPATING ARTISTS!** Don’t let your lack of experience cloud your will to join us. Please, by all means, come over and give it a try if you want to.
</WrappableParagraph>

<WrappableParagraph title="Payment">
**Of course, those are passion projects, but you will still be compensated for your work. The projects are based on revenue share, and all artists will receive revenue from the album digital sales.** If you participate, payment will be done individually and post-release, based on the album’s sales. All participating artists will take the same cut: All revenues from the sales will be divided by each individual that has worked on the release. As I (Fivda / Robin) am the one in charge of the Bandcamp and BOOTH pages, I will be in charge of banking the sales every month. **I will be sharing the total revenue across each person via PayPal, every year, in early July**, by going directly towards any individual who has contributed to any album, and tell them how much income they've accrued over the course of the past year for all combined projects and proceed with sending the payment. 

Accepting payment is not mandatory and you can refuse or stop them at any time. In any case, **please don’t expect too much from the sales. They make for some relatively okayish pocket change, but nobody will be making a living out of the album’s revenues.**

As a matter of transparency: Every now and then, we may contact artists directly, and commission them with upfront payment rather than through sales royalties. 
</WrappableParagraph>

<WrappableParagraph title="Deadlines">
Our projects generally come with a deadline, and are mostly announced long in advance so artists can find the time to contribute. You can find the deadlines on each individual project page. However, you can still submit songs to "dormant" projects which do not have deadlines yet, such as sequel albums of previously recently released albums. However, please make sure to submit your song once you are determined that you will **not** come back to it, as it can take several months, or even a solid year before your track actually gets released if the album has no deadline announced yet. **There is generally at least 12 month in between releases of the same album series** (such as "ECLECTIC RESONANCE UPRISING" and "ECLECTIC RESONANCE UPRISING 2", for example).
</WrappableParagraph>


<WrappableParagraph title="Terms of Use">
- All rights to your music are exclusively yours, even after release.
- You are free to upload your track to **YouTube/SoundCloud** at any moment once the album releases, with a link to the album in the description. You are encouraged and free to use the original key art’s illustration and logo as you see fit. **Please respect your original artist and track names, as well as their capitalization**.
- You will be free to republish your track anywhere else, reuse for a **personal solo albums/singles**, whether for commercial or free use, but only at least 12 months after the album’s initial release, and if you quote the original release of the track as “originally from “ALBUMNAME” published by KodamaSounds” somewhere in the description of your re-release.
- **You cannot republish the same track in another compilation album.**
- If at any time, you wish for your track to be **pulled off from the release, modified**, or want information changed in any way, you are free to do so at any time by **contacting us**.
- We would be glad to see any original music featured in rhythm games, whether for free or commercial use. However, this is a very case by case situation depending on the song, the game’s credits, the game itself, and for other reasons. **Please get in contact with us** so we can make appropriate arrangements.
- From July 2023 and onward: You agree that your song may be republished through other physical KodamaSounds publications, such as CDs. Due to the heavy costs and ambitions of manufacturing those, receiving royalties from individual sales are unlikely. You can however receive a copy of the physical item for free if you request it.
- Similarly to physical goods, you must agree with us publishing our albums on major streaming platforms (Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer…) after they have initially been released on Bandcamp/BOOTH (note that tribute albums will NOT be released on streaming platforms). At the moment of streaming distribution, we will ensure that your track’s metadata will be appropriately linked to the correct artist page. Such matters can be discussed with us at any time so we can adapt in the best possible ways. Just like for physical goods, streaming distribution revenues will unfortunately not warrant meaningful enough profits to be part of the royalty revenue system.
- Please note that contributing more than one song to the album does not mean you will perceive more royalties than others.

<WrappableParagraph title="Additional Information">
For the sake of transparency, here’s an explanation of how we generally proceed with our album direction: Each album concept has its own ongoing series, and are almost always constantly going, so long as there are supplied tracks by artists. Both artists and our listeners are able to check how the album projects are progressing runtime wise on our website on the “Projects” tab, by seeing how many minutes of the album has been “filled” in by artists. The runtime is calculated based on the sum of all confirmed and completed tracks submitted for the album. Work in project tracks will NOT be calculated to ensure that whoever comes first will still be able to make it on to the next release. Once we reach between 55 minutes and 70 minutes of runtime, we will tick the album as “complete”, and any new submitted tracks will not be able to make it in. However, if an album has a lot of submissions before the deadline and we do go above 70 minutes of runtime, it is possible that we may choose to make the album “2 Discs”, which means that we may run up to 140 minutes of music in total. In that case, we will be able to accept more submissions than originally planned. Once complete, the finalized album will then be formally announced and made available for the next relevant event (Comic Market and M3 for most albums, and Reitaisai/Comic Market for Touhou related albums). Any new submission will then be added to the next album, which will be a direct sequel to the previous one. And thus, the project begins anew like the previous one. That way, this ensures that our most popular album projects keep on being posted as long as the demand remains.
