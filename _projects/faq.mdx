# FAQ/Additional Information

*This section is dedicated for general guidelines that apply to all of our projects. Though quite long, it will be appreciated if you can get through it all to have a better grasp at the way the circle works.*


<WrappableParagraph title="General Rules">
The rules below apply to anyone willing to participate.
- Do not participate if you do not have basic empathy, or sense of respect towards other people. This should go without saying, but any kind of toxic/aggressive misdemeanors are prohibited. The project is centered around inclusivity and diversity.  If this is not not part of your values, please do not apply.
- (Not mandatory but highly recommended) Participate in the project’s general discussions on the [KodamaSounds discord](). If you wanna participate, say hi and tell us you’re here for that, and you shall gain access to the private artists channel. Since this is a community project, we’ll need to have you be okay with communicating about your art alongside a bunch of other artists. 
- Have a valid Paypal account if you wish to receive payment. You do not have to absolutely receive payment, but all work deserves a reward, even if it’s light!
- Keep secrecy on the project, especially when it comes to work that isn’t yours.
</WrappableParagraph>


<WrappableParagraph title="Album / Track Rules">
- Your track for the album must not have been previously published on any platform, and must be entirely new/original. The only exception to this rule is if you wish to remake a track you’ve produced before in the form of a notably different mix.
- Send us complete and objective credits for your works. Be transparent with information. We WILL need as much information as we possibly can to make accurate credits. More information in the appropriate topics below.
- Artist name must not exceed 45 characters (both japanese and romanized)
- Track name must not exceed 60 roman characters and 25 japanese characters (for kanji only tracks)
- We may ask you to change your track name/artist name if it’s inappropriate or too dense/long. Specific symbols, punctuation, spaces may also impact this decision.
- Keep secrecy on your track. Do NOT show a preview on social media. You may however post your work in progress on the appropriate Discord channel. You can announce that you participate in the album, but please do not share anything related to the album’s direct content until announcement.
- No stealing assets. This should go without saying. Resampling shouldn’t be a problem, so long as you do not claim someone else’s work as your own.
- Follow the album’s theme. We’re looking for anything that would fit in the styles mentioned in the album page. Ask us and show us examples if you have doubts on what you can do.
- You are free to send a maximum of two tracks for the same album project. But please note that this would be considered a bonus, and it would not influence the revenue share in any way since the revenue is based on the amount of participating individuals, rather than amount of tracks. There will be no revenue share difference whether you produced one or two tracks, so keep that in mind if you do this for that reason.
- Once your completed track has been confirmed and accepted for the album, you will be able to access the private artists channel dedicated to the album once the project is complete. This is where you will also be able to read the monthly revenue share as well.
</WrappableParagraph>

<WrappableParagraph title="Mix/Mastering">
Please follow those rules for the final mix of your track, and export it with those settings:
\- WAV 32bits, Floating Point.
\- Resampling Quality of 512 point-sinc.
\- Headroom around -6db to -12db.
\- Do not use any Limiter or Clipper on the Mix Bus.

### Side notes
- Going through our own mastering engineer is not necessary if your track already went through professional Mixing/Mastering, or if you are a professional yourself. But please note that we may post-master your track lightly if the sound is deemed too strong/low compared to the rest of the tracks on the album.
- Same above rules apply to full tracks or individual tracks in case of mastering by stems.
- Make sure your mix is as accurate as you can make it. The point of mastering isn't about fixing mixing errors, but about improving the sound of the final release.
- If you are not sure about the sound of your final mix, you can share it on our Discord community if you want a second opinion from other artists or the album’s mastering engineer.

<WrappableParagraph title="File Information">
You can go through the usual Google Forms enclosed on each project page to send us your track, or you can also send it to us directly through mail, Twitter, or Discord. Going through the Forms means the file will be directly uploaded, and that’s about it. If you send it directly to us, please go through a hosting site like Google Drive/MEGA, and send the access link alongside your credit information (see below)

Make sure to enclose any mixing information for the mastering of your track with your submission. If you want the mastering engineer to monitor your master, please get in direct contact with them. (Contact information available on each project page)
</WrappableParagraph>

<WrappableParagraph title="Credits Guidelines">
For manual and direct submission, please format the credits of your musical submission in such a way and send it to Fivda (contact information all the way down):
- **Mix/Master of your track (as explained above)**
- **A timestamp for the 35+ Seconds long preview of your choice for your track** (.wav preferred, but it can be .mp3 or other) for the preview/announcement
- **Detailed Credits Exactly as Shown:**
Please make sure to input any Circle/Organization name following each name as a suffix (except for “Display Artist”) if you have any to disclose. Please use proper casing, as we will display the text exactly as input.

**IMPORTANT NOTE FOR PEOPLE USING JAPANESE:**
If you are using an artist name and track name containing kana/kanji, please let us know of the exact romanized reading for both of them. We prefer localized/translated track names over basic romanization, and uniformized artist names. (Example: “Chikyuu no De [地球の出]”) If you don’t think you have the skill to translate your japanese trackname, you can leave it to us. Make sure to input both english/japanese names in the credits. If you want to go with a kana/kanji name, it will only be visible on BOOTH. Other platforms/the website will be using your romanized reading/translated track name.
</WrappableParagraph>


<WrappableParagraph title="Scope">
We can’t stress this enough: For our KodamaSounds projects, **EVERYONE IS INVITED, AND THERE’S NO LIMIT TO THE AMOUNT OF PARTICIPATING ARTISTS!** Don’t let your lack of experience cloud your will to join us. Please, by all means, come over and give it a try if you want to.
</WrappableParagraph>

<WrappableParagraph title="Payment">
**Of course, those are passion projects, but you will still be compensated for your work. The projects are based on revenue share, and all artists will receive revenue from the album digital sales.** If you participate, payment will be done individually and post-release, based on the album’s sales. All participating artists will take the same cut: All revenues from the sales will be divided by each individual that has worked on the release. As I (Fivda / Robin) am the one in charge of the Bandcamp and BOOTH pages, I will be in charge of banking the sales every month, and as I have done with previous albums, I will be sharing the total revenue across each person via PayPal, whenever needed (most people usually ask for the payout every few months, as requesting for the payout every month can be a repetitive process with little compensation considering our generally modest sales). 

Accepting payment is not mandatory and you can refuse or stop them at any time. In any case, **please don’t expect too much from the sales. They make for some relatively okayish pocket change, but nobody will be making a living out of the album’s revenues.**
</WrappableParagraph>

<WrappableParagraph title="Deadlines">
Our album projects in early development have no deadlines: The album project will be over once we reach our usual threshold of runtime, and be released at the closest-coming M3/Comic Market/Reitaisai event. However, if a currently going project is taking too long to be completed, we may fix a deadline to the album project once we reach 50% of completion, to generate some more activity and life in the project. If that happens, you will see the deadline on the general project page as well as within the project pages themselves.
</WrappableParagraph>


<WrappableParagraph title="Terms of Use">
All rights to your music are exclusively yours. You are free to upload your track to YouTube/SoundCloud at any moment **once the album releases, with a link to the album in the description.** You will also be free to republish your track anywhere else, reuse for any other album, whether for commercial or free use, **but only at least 12 months after the album release, and if you quote the original release of the track as “originally from “ALBUMNAME” published by KodamaSounds” somewhere in the description of your re-release**. You can use any art/logo asset used in the release for your publication as well. If at any time, you wish for your track to be pulled off from the release, modified, or want information changed in any way, you are free to do so at any time by contacting us. 
</WrappableParagraph>


<WrappableParagraph title="Additional Information">
For the sake of transparency, here’s an explanation of how we generally proceed with our album direction: Each album concept has its own ongoing series, and are almost always constantly going, so long as there are supplied tracks by artists. Both artists and our listeners are able to check how the album projects are progressing runtime wise on our website on the “Projects” tab, by seeing how many minutes of the album has been “filled” in by artists. The runtime is calculated based on the sum of all confirmed and completed tracks submitted for the album. Work in project tracks will NOT be calculated to ensure that whoever comes first will still be able to make it on to the next release. Once we reach between 55 minutes and 70 minutes of runtime, we will tick the album as “complete”, and any new submitted tracks will not be able to make it in. Once complete, the finalized album will then be formally announced and made available for the next relevant event (Comic Market and M3 for most albums, and Reitaisai/Comic Market for Touhou related albums). Any new submission will then be added to the next album, which will be a direct sequel to the previous one. And thus, the project begins anew like the previous one. That way, this ensures that our most popular album projects keep on being posted as long as the demand remains.

You can submit your track at any time, and it will be added to the upcoming album. Due to the nature of how our system works, it’s **not really possible to anticipate release dates, even approximately**. You may anticipate the general release window by checking the advancement of each project by taking a look at the current runtime or percentage, but please know that it may be more or less random, as track submissions may come up at any time. **Albums will have a fixed release date only when the selection has been finalized and the threshold reaches 100%.**
