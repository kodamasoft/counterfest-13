# Gensokyo Party Vol. 6 Border in Stasis

*The barrier that once held Gensokyo together and free of the turmoil of the outside world is no more. The shrine maiden is at a standstill, faced with the ruins of what once was her home - saccaged and ruined by the turmoil of the outside world. Now, Gensokyo is nothing but the shadow of its former self. Fragments and shards of memories scattered around, old friends and enemies alike now fight for their lives. As some try to rebuild what they loved and holds firm, the other ones try to move on and build something anew.*

<WrappableParagraph title="Presentation">
“Border in Stasis” is a conceptual Touhou arrange album project, and is probably our most ambitious one to this day. “Gensokyo in Ruins” is the keyword, and advocates the melancholy of Gensokyo, deprived of its former glory. It’s up to you to represent this concept to the best of your ability - through emotional pieces, songs of recollection, and tunes of turmoil.

<WrappableParagraph title="Border in Stasis Specific Music Rules">
- Your submission must be only related to the Touhou series. No partial arrangement of any other series should be presented in your submission. You can however, of course, mix multiple games/tracks in your submission as long as all source material originates from Touhou.
- No original music from fangames should be arranged. The games you can arrange for this album are the official PC & PC-98 Team Shanghai Alice and Twilight Frontier games. Meaning that you can still remix music from spinoffs, U2 Akiyama and NKZ tracks so long as they are official. You can also remix original tracks from ZUN’s music collections and Seihou project.
- You cannot rearrange tracks from other doujin albums. Slight and obvious references may be permitted depending on how important it is to the track. This is a subject of discussion, so make sure to ask and show us an example if you plan on doing this.
- [Please check the track claiming Google Sheet page to add the track(s) & game(s) you wish to arrange in the form of a comment on a line of cells](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VI1EsFkp2M0WET12066kTCzz6OOJujNJxmwPCaMrqY0/edit?usp=sharing). Tracks from the last released Gensokyo Party album are generally on cooldown. We crave variety, so make sure you avoid picking a track someone else might do as well. Please note that tracks on cool down tracks may change, as we constantly release Touhou albums every now and then.
- Your track needs to be at least 3 minutes long, and cannot exceed 11 minutes.
- Follow the theme. Although there’s no limit to the style or genre you can display, preferably, we’re looking for anything that would fit in the themes said above. Rather than a specific genre or style of music, we are looking for tunes which stay true to the description of the album. Genres with an emphasis on crystalline and reverby sounds are strongly recommended. Ask us and show us examples if you have doubts on what you can do. Here are some genres/keywords that may help you:
    - *“Disorder”*
    - *“Reconstruction”*
    - *“Uncertainty”*
    - *“Hope vs Despair”*
    - *Artcore*
    - *IDM*
    - *Piano*
    - Strings
    - Chamber & Orchestral Music
    - Minimal & Lowtempo
    - Uplifting / Progressive Trance
    - Color Bass
    - Experimental Electronic Music
