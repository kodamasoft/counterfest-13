# ECLECTIC RESONANCE Legendaria

*Legends once foretold of a magical music compilation… One with heroic pieces, and warm songs of nostalgia. ECLECTIC RESONANCE Legendaria is a tale not to be forgotten… Warning: This album may contain tunes only fit for slaying demon lords, wandering through neverending mossy forests, drinking at the tavern, and more.*

<WrappableParagraph title="Presentation">
“Legendaria” is the Fantasy variant of our “ECLECTIC RESONANCE” original work album series, where the featured tracks are inspired by JRPGs, Anime soundtracks, classical and celtic music. Classical instruments evocating fantasy sceneries are recommended. Feel free to inspire yourself with the style of your favorite RPG songs and composers for this album!
